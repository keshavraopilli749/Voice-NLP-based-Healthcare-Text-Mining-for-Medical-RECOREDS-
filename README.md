## 📌 Overview

This project leverages **voice input** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract and analyze key information from **spoken medical records**. It automates the conversion of medical voice notes into structured, readable, and meaningful text – enabling faster, more accurate clinical documentation and analysis.

Whether for hospitals, diagnostic centers, or personal health tracking, this system reduces the manual effort of note-taking, improves accessibility, and supports better decision-making with machine intelligence.

## 🌟 Features

- **Voice-to-Text Conversion**: Real-time speech recognition for medical dictation
- **NLP Analysis**: Advanced text processing for medical terminology and context
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies diseases, symptoms, dates, names, and medications
- **Relationship Extraction**: Analyzes medical relationships and connections
- **Modern UI**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant feedback and analysis of medical records
- **Secure Data Handling**: Safe processing of sensitive medical information
- **Data Export**: Saves structured data into various formats (.txt, .csv, database)

Let me know if you'd like me to:
- Add a `requirements.txt` file
- Push this `README.md` directly to your repo (I can provide the exact git commands)
- Help you convert this into a web app using Flask or Streamlit for deployment
